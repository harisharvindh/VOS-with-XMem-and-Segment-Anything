# VOS-with-XMem-and-Segment-Anything
Overview:
XMem is a cutting-edge tool for long-term video object segmentation, utilizing the principles of the Atkinson-Shiffrin memory model. This project aims to provide a robust solution for tracking and segmenting objects in video sequences over extended periods, even under challenging conditions like changing perspectives, varying lighting, and occlusion.

Atkinson-Shiffrin Memory Model

Our approach is grounded in the Atkinson-Shiffrin memory model, which includes sensory memory, short-term memory, and long-term memory. We leverage these concepts to enhance the stability and accuracy of object segmentation over time.
